In this page, you'll find links to the rules that manage every contact point between me and you, here in the blog, or every social network and subdomain.

Please, note that these pages could be updated periodically, and it's in your account, for being a user from one from everywhere on my management, to look at these policies and terms regularly.

If you don't agree with some of these terms, please, don't interact with anything at this site. If you have some questions, please, [get me in touch here](mailto:leo@leocarvalho.dev).
